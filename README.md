#  Optical Handwriten Character Recognization. 

In this Project we are using CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) for Optical Handwriten Character Recognization. 

A Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet/CNN) is a Deep Learning algorithm which can take in an input image, assign importance (learnable weights and biases) to various aspects/objects in the image, and be able to differentiate one from the other.

Also in the other branches of this repo we have tried Optical Handwriten Character Recognization using the easyOCR and pytesseract lib avaible in python 

EasyOCR is a python based OCR library that extracts the text from the image. It's a ready-to-use OCR with 40+ languages supported including Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Thai. Itâ€™s an open-source project licensed under Apache 2.0.

Tesseract is an open-source text recognition (OCR) Engine, available under the Apache 2.0 license. It can be used directly, or (for programmers) using an API to extract printed text from images. It supports a wide variety of languages.
